SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains various SQL projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and experience in database management, data analysis, and SQL query writing. The projects are organized into two main categories:

Key Skills:

Writing complex SQL queries for data retrieval using SELECT statements.
Using WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses to filter, join, group, and sort data.
Filtering data with conditional operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
Aggregate Functions

Using aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX() to summarize data.
Subqueries

Writing subqueries for more complex data retrieval (e.g., nested SELECT queries).
Data Manipulation

INSERT: Adding new records to a table.
UPDATE: Modifying existing records in a table.
DELETE: Removing records from a table.
Joins and Relationships

INNER JOIN: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
LEFT JOIN (OUTER JOIN): Fetching all records from one table and matching rows from another table.
RIGHT JOIN (OUTER JOIN): Fetching all records from the second table and matching rows from the first.
FULL JOIN: Fetching records from both tables, even when there is no match.
CROSS JOIN: Creating a Cartesian product of two tables.
Indexes and Performance Optimization

Writing stored procedures for reusable SQL code.
Creating user-defined functions to encapsulate logic.
Data Integrity and Constraints

Using constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT to enforce data integrity.
Defining relationships between tables with foreign key constraints.
Views and Virtual Tables

Working with different SQL data types like VARCHAR, INT, DATE, FLOAT, and BOOLEAN.
Backup and Restore

Understanding basic database backup and restore commands to safeguard data.
