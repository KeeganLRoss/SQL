# SQL
SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains various SQL projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and experience in database management, data analysis, and SQL query writing. The projects are organized into two main categories:

Certification Course Projects: SQL exercises and real-world scenarios from my formal training and certification courses.
Teaching Projects: SQL projects created from data I gathered while teaching various topics. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with educational datasets and provide insights using SQL.
