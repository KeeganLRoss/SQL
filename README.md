SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains various SQL projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and experience in database management, data analysis, and SQL query writing. The projects are organized into two main categories:

Certification Course Projects: SQL exercises and real-world scenarios from my formal training and certification courses.
Teaching Projects: SQL projects created from data I gathered while teaching various topics. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with educational datasets and provide insights using SQL.

Certification Course Projects
This section contains SQL projects that I completed as part of my certification courses. These projects helped me build a strong foundation in SQL, including data manipulation, query optimization, and working with complex datasets.

Project 1: E-commerce Sales Analysis
Description: In this project, I worked with an e-commerce database to analyze sales data. The goal was to create SQL queries to find sales trends, product performance, and customer purchase behaviors.
Key Skills:
Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
GROUP BY, HAVING
Filtering data with WHERE clauses
Subqueries
SQL Queries:
Finding the top-selling products in the last quarter.
Analyzing the sales by region.
Identifying customers with the highest average spend.
Project 2: Employee Database Management
Description: This project involved working with a fictional company's employee database. I wrote queries to manage employee information, track promotions, and calculate compensation details.

Key Skills:

Data insertion, update, and deletion
Creating and modifying tables
Working with dates and times
Writing complex SELECT statements
SQL Queries:

Finding employees eligible for promotion based on performance.
Calculating the annual salary for each employee.
Tracking employee attendance and work hours.
Teaching Projects
These projects involve real-world datasets I collected during my teaching sessions. These projects showcase my ability to apply SQL to educational data and extract meaningful insights.

Project 1: Student Performance Analysis
Description: In this project, I analyzed data from a class of students. The goal was to find trends in student performance and determine factors that contributed to high or low scores.
Key Skills:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Working with multiple tables using JOINs
Aggregating and grouping data by different parameters
Using window functions for ranking and partitioning
SQL Queries:
Calculating average scores per subject.
Ranking students based on their total scores.
Identifying correlations between study hours and grades.
Project 2: Class Attendance Tracker
Description: This project involved creating a database to track student attendance over a semester. The project aimed to identify patterns in student attendance and investigate the relationship between attendance and grades.
Key Skills:
Data insertion and updates
Creating relationships between tables (students, classes, attendance)
Using CASE WHEN statements for conditional logic
Time-series analysis with SQL
SQL Queries:
Calculating attendance percentages for each student.
Analyzing attendance trends over the course of the semester.
Identifying students with the lowest attendance.
Technologies Used
SQL: Structured Query Language for database management and querying.
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
Tools:
DBMSs (Database Management Systems) like MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver
Data visualization tools (if applicable)
Version control with Git
